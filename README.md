# MultiModalPDNBs
In this work, by integrating Dynamic Network Biomarker theory and the multi-modal optimization, here we developed a novel multi-modal optimization model based on evolutionary algorithm for Personalized Dynamic Network Biomarkers identification (namely, MMPDNB) for early diagnosis and treatment of individual patients in disease precision medicine.
